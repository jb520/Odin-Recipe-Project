        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream together sugar and softened butter</li>
            <li>Add eggs</li>
            <li>Add vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Add baking powder, salt, and flour</li>
            <li>Mix or knead until a shaggy dough forms</li>
            <li>Separate dough into two equal halves</li>
            <li>Roll one half into a log and shape into long rectangle</li>
            <li>Wrap the rectangle in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill (This will be your vanilla dough!)</li>
            <li>With remaining half of dough, add cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Mix or knead until color is even throughout</li>
            <li>Repeat log to rectangle shaping process and place in fridge to chill (You guessed it! The chocolate dough!)</li>
            <li>After both doughs have chilled for ~2hrs, remove them from the fridge and cut into four strips each</li>
            <ul><li>The easiest way for me to do it is cut in half the long way and then cut those halves in half again</li>
                <li>You're aiming for long square shaped strips</li></ul>
            <li>Reassemble the cookie logs by stacking the doughs in an alternanting pattern</li>
            <li>Press franken logs together for better adhesion, re-wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for ~1hr</li>
            <li>When ready to bake simply remove them from the fridge, slice into cookie sized pieces and bake!</li>
