        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It's a really good sandwich/dessert. Plus I could never forget how I somehow managed to full on spill this all over my husband's pants the first time I made it for us on a picnic.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fruit of choice</li>
            <li>Whipping cream</li>
            <li>Sugar or condensed milk</li>
            <li>Fluffy bread (like milk bread)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cut fruit into desired size</li>
            <li>Set aside</li>
            <li>In a bowl wisk cream (by hand or with a hand mixer, stand mixer, etc) until stiff peaks form</li>
            <li>Once cream is almost set drizzle in condensed milk (just eyeball it)</li>
            <li>Fold condensed milk into whipped cream, if it falls/breaks just whip it into shape again</li>
            <li>Place cream into fridge to set (I want to say like 15-30 minutes maybe but i don't really know)</li>
            <li>Aquire your bread and place a generous spread of cream on one slice</li>
            <li>Layer fruit over cream, try not to overstuff the sandwich</li>
            <li>Layer more cream and top with second bread slice</li>
            <li>Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and maybe let chill for a little bit for besat results</li>
            <li>For cuteness, cut sandwich (still in plastic wrap for structure) on a diagonal and hopefully it'll look really cute and yummy</li>
            <li>Enjoy! (:</li>
        </ol>
